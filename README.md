Cannlytics is simple, easy-to-use, **end-to-end** cannabis analytics software designed to make your data and information accessible. Cannlytics makes cannabis analysis **simple** and **easy** through data accessibility. We believe that everyone in the cannabis industry should be able to access rich, valuable data quickly and easily and that you will be better off for it. This documentation covers the Cannlytics architecture and how to build, develop, and publish the Cannlytics platform. You can view the platform live at <https://console.cannlytics.com> and the documentation at <https://docs.cannlytics.com>.

## üå± Installation <a name="installation"></a>

In your root directory, you will need to create a `.firebaserc` file that looks like:

```json
{
  "projects": {
    "default": "your-project"
  },
  "targets": {
    "your-project": {
      "hosting": {
        "docs": [
          "your-project-docs"
        ]
      }
    }
  }
}
```

## üî® Development <a name="development"></a>

Documentation for the project is written in [Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/). Building the documentation locally requires installing [Material for MkDocs](https://squidfunk.github.io/mkdocs-material/) and [Docker](https://www.docker.com/get-started). The configuration for the documentation is contained within `mkdocs.yml`. You can serve the documentation locally by first pulling and building the Material for MKDocs image:

```shell
docker pull squidfunk/mkdocs-material
docker build -t squidfunk/mkdocs-material docs
```

Once setup, you can preview the documentation as you write:

```shell
docker run --rm -it -p 8000:8000 -v squidfunk/mkdocs-material
```

or

```shell
npm run docs
```

> Note that there is [a namespace conflict between `django-livereload-server` and `livereload`](https://gist.github.com/hangtwenty/f53b3867db1e33780505ccafd8d2eef0), so you need to be careful when and where you install Python requirements. If you run into a `django-livereload-server` import error, first check that `PRODUCTION = False` in your `console/settings.py` and then follow [these instructions](https://gist.github.com/hangtwenty/f53b3867db1e33780505ccafd8d2eef0) to uninstall `livereload` and reinstall  `django-livereload-server`.

## üöÄ Publishing <a name="publishing"></a>

When you are ready, you can build the documentation:

```shell
npm run build-docs
```

You can publish the documentation to Firebase Hosting with one simple command:

```shell
firebase deploy --project your-project --only hosting:docs
```
