## Cannabis Data Marketplace

Cannlytics offers the first cannabis data marketplace! Cannlytics will provide a marketplace for people to peruse, purchase, and sell cannabis data. You can warehouse your cannabis data, get a value for your data, and get paid for your data. For example, a laboratory or a large producer could sell an anonymized dataset for data consumers to purchase.

-> Buy and sell curated cannabis data.


Data is made available by publishing a dataset in an Initial Data Offering (IDO).

### Data Wallets

Data wallets are for data custody and data management.

### Data Ownership

Having data custody means that you hold access to the data via a datatoken. 

Each dataset has 1 datatoken associated with it. If you own the datatoken, then you have the sole right to access the dataset.


### Data Management

Data management is the process of sharing data with other people, by sending them datatokens.

### Data Co-Op

Data can be aggregated by multiple data providers to increase bargaining power.

### Data Investing

Buy into a basket of datasets.

### Data Subscriptions

You can subscribe to series of data and receive the latest data when it is published.

### Pricing Data

The price of data is established in a marketplace as it is sold.


## Development

```bash
pip install --ignore-installed PyYAML
