## Get started with the Cannlytics LIMS

The Cannlytics laboratory information management system (LIMS) allows labs that test cannabis to receive samples, perform analyses, collect and review results, and publish certificates of analysis (CoAs). Cannlytics makes lab results and CoA PDFs available through a client portal and with private links. With a cherry top, Cannlytics allows you to integrate and communicate directly with any state-mandated traceability system.
