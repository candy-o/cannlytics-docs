# Transfers

Transfers are transferred inventory between organizations, such as samples sent from a cultivator or processor to a lab. Transfers can be created by either the sending or receiving organization and the transfer is received by the receiving organization. When a transfer is received by the receiving organization, an intake, worksheet, and labels can be created to expedite analyses.
