# Traceability

Cannlytics traceability module allows you to integrate with either the [Leaf Data Systems](https://leafdatasystems.com/) or [Metrc](https://www.metrc.com/) traceability systems. You can swap out components for others. For example, Cannlytics users can swap out Leaf integration for Metrc integration. Separating your choice of each component from another, Cannlytics frees you to integrate with the traceability system of any state that you operate in, freeing administrators and developers to focus on their preferred area of specialization.
